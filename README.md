## Team Ice Cream Scoop: Helping You Move Since 2018






### Consent Form

#### Who are we?
We are a group of students from Olin College of Engineering taking a course in User Experience Design. Our team is researching moving pains with the goal of using our findings to develop a solution with a positive user experience.

#### What do we want from you?
We’d like to speak to you about your moving experiences and possibly receive feedback on prototypes. Your feedback is crucial to us creating a positive user experience. Engineering doesn’t happen in a bubble; your input from people outside of our project will help us look at our ideas in new ways and challenge our assumptions. We respect your time and anticipate this interaction will last less than a half hour.

We will collect information by...
- Taking notes
- Taking photos
- Recording audio
- Recording video
- Keeping artifacts created during co-design

#### What are the risks or benefits?
We don’t expect any risk to you. We won’t collect personal information or personally identify you when we talk about our project to others. Additionally, you are free at any time to leave, change topics, or request we not use the anonymous information we do collect if for any reason you feel uncomfortable. These conversations are purely voluntary, and no monetary compensation will be offered. However, there will be the added benefit to you of knowing that your opinions directly help us in our learning!
